# Secure Sim
A Deployable Secure Data Processing API (Middleware Layer)
You'll have a production-ready, Dockerized system that any developer or app can use to securely handle sensitive data — without needing to understand Gramine, encryption, or enclave logic.

🔐 What It Will Do (Features)
Expose REST API endpoints (via FastAPI):

/encrypt: Accepts plaintext data, returns encrypted output

/decrypt: Accepts ciphertext, returns plaintext

/seal: Seals data to disk (Gramine-secure)

/unseal: Unseals sealed data back to readable form

(Optional): /status, /metrics, /health

Process requests inside Gramine (SGX-compatible):

Guarantees protection of data in use

Ensures any computation happens in a trusted enclave

Encrypts and seals files/data for:

Data at rest (tamper-proof sealed storage)

Data in transit (API communication over HTTPS)

Data in use (within enclave)

Reusable inside any application:

Plug it into a chat app to protect messages

Use it for secure file storage

Pipe it into any backend requiring encryption + attestation

Runs in Docker with Gramine:

Portable, isolated, and enclave-secured

Easy to deploy on servers, edge devices, or private clouds

🧩 Integration Use-Cases
Chat App: Send messages → Encrypt → Process inside Gramine → Return ciphertext → Store or transmit

File Vault: Upload file → Seal and store securely → Retrieve later via unseal

Secure Analytics: Push logs → Process in-memory → Delete or seal results

Dev Tooling: Expose this as a CLI or SDK to use programmatically
